    <h1>Core Interaction</h1>
    <p>Nicole Kapper</p>
    <h2>Hello here is a poem for you</h2>
    <p> Brighten your day
Brighten your life
learn in here
To happily survive

Smile, smile and smile
In rain or sunshine
And wear brightness
All for a while

And when troubles come
Don't let them stay
For too long to
Spoil your lovely day

Just be strong
And hang in there
And shun all your
deep hidden fears

Adopt a positive
Attitude my dear
And know life is hard
And at times fair

So hang in there
And brighten your day
with a beautiful smile
Of happiness bay.
