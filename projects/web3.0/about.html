           With this project, I want to flip traditional advertising and collaboration on its head.
           I want to create an interactive platform for the posting of "coloring book sheets" with little pressure
           and lots of fun. With this form of content, I find the stress is low when creating and an artist
           (and everyday person) can create an interactive piece with ease. These "coloring book sheets" also serve as
           a therapeutic outlet for viewers and participants. This platform would, in turn, serve as a way for creatives
           to post downloadable material bring attention to their work/company.
